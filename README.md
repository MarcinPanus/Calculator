The temperature calculator allows you to convert the temperature between degrees Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin.

I used **Bootstrap** to style the design of the website and **Firebase** for hosting and creating a **realtime database**.
I wrote 12 **unit tests** using the javascript framework - **Jest**.
